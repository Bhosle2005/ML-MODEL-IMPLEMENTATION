## DESCRIPTION
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the classic Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the complete pipeline of a supervised regression model, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The aim is to predict continuous features of the iris flower dataset while showcasing model accuracy through regression metrics.

## KEY FEATURES:
* Dataset:
Classic Iris dataset featuring sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width as features.
* Model:
Implements regression models to predict one feature (e.g., petal width) based on others.
* Metrics:
Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
* Code Highlights:
Efficient data handling using Python libraries like pandas and numpy.
Model implementation using scikit-learn.
Visualization with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.
